# Running your code #


To run all tests at once, run:
```bash
$ cd evaluation/
$ make evaluate
```

To run a single milestone, run:
```bash
$ cd evaluation/
$ make first
$ make second
$ make third
...
```

The evaluation tool uses
[Google's C++ Testing Framework](https://code.google.com/p/googletest/).
The last 3 Milestones tests are not implemented. The tests ready to run
but will *FAIL* by default. You will have to implement these tests using
Google's API.
